# make-temperature-movie
Temperature Graphs:
 - overshoot.png, worstCase.png and bestcase.png are the three different scenarios with monthly, annual and per decade means. 
 - graphs.png is a graph of all three scenarios, only yearly mean
 - GraphsTogetherAnim.py, if fixed in time, will create GraphAnimation.mp4, a useless but interesting animation. 
 
Temperature Videos:
 - #finalvideo.py creates all three scenario animations. It needs an argument: ssp119, ssp585 or ssp534OS
 - H_Vid_NC's create the normal colour videos
 - SplitTempVideo.py creates the video split in half, taking two arguments out of ssp119, ssp585 and ssp534OS
 
Other:
 - rainfall.py creates rainfall.avi, the video of daily rainfall for 1850. 
 - gpp_chlrphyl.py creates gpp_chlrphyl.avi, the combined video of gross primary productivity on land and chlorophyl in the         oceans.
